# There are a couple of ways to manage dependencies in SBT
# One way that works is by providing the artifactory repo 
# Krishnas recommended way is to add proxies locatted in this same folder for java, sbt and command line
# Remember that the main sbt program is located under /apps/sbt
# Then there are configurations within the local directory
# And then configurations within the local project
