# There are a couple of ways to manage dependencies in SBT
# One way that works is by providing the artifactory repo 
# Krishnas recommended way is to add proxies locatted in this same folder for java, sbt and command line
# Remember that the main sbt program is located under /apps/sbt
# Then there are configurations within the local directory
# And then configurations within the local project
#
#
# To push the code from personal account you need to unset the proxy within git globally and locally
#
#git config --global --unset http.proxy 
#git config --unset http.proxy
#git config --unset https.proxy
